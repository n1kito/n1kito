# Hello !

My name is Matthieu, I'm a software engineering student at 42 in Paris, and currently looking for an internship in the field of product-oriented software development. In addition to my interest in the technical aspects of development, I am very keen on identifying and understanding user needs and wish to continue learning to develop solutions that optimally meet these needs.

## 🔭 Working on

I recently released a [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/runway-downloader/phjakjnniknfkoaiihgabnpclaejodkp) aimed at fashion professionnals, and am actively working on adding new features.

I'm also working on a mobile application for healthcare professionals specializing in cardiovascular health, which implements tools from the European Society of Cardiology to help practitioners assess the cardiovascular health of their patients.

## 🌱 Currently learning

I'm currently working on my first projects in **Python**, as well as the **cybersecurity** branch of the curriculum at 42 🔐
