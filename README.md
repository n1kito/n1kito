# Hello !

My name is Matthieu, I'm a software engineering student at 42 in Paris, and currently finishing my second internship in the field of product-oriented software development. In addition to my interest in the technical aspects of development, I am very keen on identifying and understanding user needs and wish to continue learning to develop solutions that optimally meet these needs.

## 🔭 Working on

💼 I recently finished an internship as Data & Web Developer at LVMH Beauty Tech, Christian Dior Parfums.

👨🏻‍💻 I recently released a [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/runway-downloader/phjakjnniknfkoaiihgabnpclaejodkp) aimed at fashion professionnals, and am actively working on adding new features.

## 🌱 Currently learning

I'm currently working on my some Data Science projects 📈.
